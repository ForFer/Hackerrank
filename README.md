#Hackerrank

Different challenges of hackerrank, with the objective of both, learning how to code better, implement better solutions, and develop my problem solving skills. Every challenge will have the problem description, alongside the input and output expected for the base case

Most of the solutions (if not all) will be in python.

List of important implementations:

* Quicksort --> Algorithms/sorting

* Insertion sort --> Algorithms/sorting

* Bubble sort --> 30-Day/day20Sorting.py

* Binary tree --> outside of folders (with level-order traversal, bfs extraction, height calculation)

* Fenwick/Binary indexed tree --> BITTree.py (clear, with examples) and dataStructures/directConnection.py

* Kruskal's algorithm --> algorithms/graphTheory

* Graph implementation --> algorithms/graphTheory/bfs.py

* Graph implementation using adjacency matrix --> algorithms/graphTheory/primsSpecialSubtree.py

* Prim's algorithm --> algorithms/graphTheory/primsSpecialSubtree.py (TODO:user another data structure to improve efficiency)

* Classification and Regrestion Tree (CART) --> artificialIntelligence/machineLearning/laptopBatteryLife.py 

* Prime checker in O(sqrt{n}) --> 30-day/25-RunningTime.pyyy
