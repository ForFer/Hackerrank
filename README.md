# Hackerrank & learning bits

Different challenges of hackerrank, with the objective of both, learning how to code better, implement better solutions, and develop my problem solving skills. Every challenge will have the problem description, alongside the input and output expected for the base case

Most of the solutions (if not all) will be in python.
